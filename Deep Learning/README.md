# Deep Learning Specialization
This folder contains my assignment work for Andrew Ng's course <i>Deep Learning Specialization<i/>

The specialization course consists of five courses:

  1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning] (https://github.com/dheerajnbhat/deeplearning.ai-courses/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Course%201%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)
  2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization] (https://github.com/dheerajnbhat/deeplearning.ai-courses/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Course%202%20-%20Improving%20Neural%20Networks%20Hyperparameters%20Tuning%2C%20Regularization%2C%20Optimization)
  3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects
  4. [Convolutional Neural Networks] (https://github.com/dheerajnbhat/deeplearning.ai-courses/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Course%204%20-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks)
  5. [Sequence Models] (https://github.com/dheerajnbhat/deeplearning.ai-courses/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Course%205%20-%20Sequence%20Models)
